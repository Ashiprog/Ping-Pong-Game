# Detailed Description of Ping Pong Game

Imports and Initialization:

Imports: 
Imports necessary modules (Screen, Paddle, Ball, Scoreboard, Partition) from respective Python files.

Screen Setup: 
Creates a Screen object (my_screen) with the following configurations:
Background color set to black (bgcolor("black")).
Screen size set to 800 pixels width and 600 pixels height (screensize(canvwidth=800, canvheight=600)).
Window title set to "THE PING PONG GAME" (title("THE PING PONG GAME")).
Disables automatic updates (tracer(0)) to manually control screen updates.

Game Objects Initialization:
Paddles: Creates two paddles (paddle_1 and paddle_2) using the Paddle class initialized at positions (350, 0) and (-350, 0) respectively.
Ball: Creates a ball (ball) using the Ball class.
Scoreboard: Initializes a scoreboard (scoreboard) using the Scoreboard class.
Partition: Initializes a partition (partition) using the Partition class, presumably for game aesthetics or boundaries.

Game Setup and Controls:
Game State: Sets game_is_on to "true" to control the main game loop.
Keyboard Binding: Listens for keyboard events using my_screen.listen() and binds the following keys to paddle movements:
Up and Down arrow keys for paddle_1 (my_screen.onkey(fun=paddle_1.move_up, key="Up") and my_screen.onkey(fun=paddle_1.move_down, key="Down")).
w and s keys for paddle_2 (my_screen.onkey(fun=paddle_2.move_up, key="w") and my_screen.onkey(fun=paddle_2.move_down, key="s")).

Game Loop Execution:
Main Loop: Uses a while loop (while game_is_on) to continuously update the game state:
Introduces a small delay (time.sleep(0.2)) to control game speed.
Updates the screen to reflect changes made (my_screen.update()).
Moves the ball (ball.move_ball()) based on its current velocity.

Collision Detection and Game Logic:
Ball Boundaries: Checks if the ball exceeds vertical boundaries (ball.ycor() > 280 or ball.ycor() < -280) and makes it bounce vertically (ball.bounce_y()).
Paddle Collisions: Detects collisions with paddles:
If the ball is close to paddle_1 (ball.distance(paddle_1) < 50 and ball.xcor() > 330), it bounces horizontally (ball.bounce_x()).
If the ball is close to paddle_2 (ball.distance(paddle_2) < 50 and ball.xcor() < -330), it similarly bounces horizontally.

Score Tracking and Updates:
Scoreboard: Tracks and updates scores based on ball interactions with screen boundaries:
If the ball passes the right boundary (ball.xcor() > 390), refreshes the ball position, increments the left player's score using scoreboard.increase_score_left(), and makes the ball bounce horizontally.
If the ball passes the left boundary (ball.xcor() < -390), refreshes the ball position, increments the right player's score using scoreboard.increase_score_right(), and makes the ball bounce horizontally.

Game Termination:
Exit on Click: Waits for the user to click anywhere on the screen (my_screen.exitonclick()) to exit the game.
